# Medogram Project

This repository contains a Django monorepo powering the **Medogram** platform. The project is structured as multiple reusable apps under one Django project.

## Contents
- **certificate/** – medico‑legal certificate generation
- **doctor_online/** – real‑time list of on‑call doctors
- **down/** – download routes and related views
- **medagent/** – LangChain based chatbot utilities
- **medogram/** – project settings and root configuration
- **sub/** – subscription and billing logic
- **telemedicine/** – wallet management, visits, authentication and blog

Shared templates live in the `templates/` directory and automated tests reside inside each app's `tests/` folder.

## Quick start
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Apply database migrations and run tests:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   pytest
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The default settings use SQLite and local caching. Environment variables can override database and email configuration as required.

## Testing
`pytest` is configured via `pytest.ini` to ensure at least 90 % coverage across all apps. Run `pytest` to execute the suite and generate a coverage report in `coverage_html_report/`.
